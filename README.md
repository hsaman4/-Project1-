# What is this website?
This website is a news site, with many different stories. So far this site has 2 pages, the home page and a second page with the full article. The webiste is responsive in desktop and mobile. I used HTML, CSS and Javascript to build the website. I used javascript to implement desisgns like the Read More button on page two, and the modal for Book of th Day. I also used CSS to add the fading on a button.Later on, I would like to add more pages and make all the links functional.
# What did I struggle with?
My webste is flexbox heavy and I struggled with that the most. Sizing and arranging the different articles and images was difficult but it made my webiste looked more organized.
# What did I get out of this project:
After completing this project I have a greater understanding of flexbox and how to manipulate the DOM. Also, implementing javascript into the website, helped me understand the concepts more.
